Background

Due to my fascination with the Linux operating system, I wanted to create something clever to enhance my
Linux experience. As I have a massive collection of video games,
I thought that making a bash script program to manage it would be a great way to increase my knowledge,
when it comes to how using Linux terminal and programming things for it. I have some basic knowledge to 
start off with as I completed the Basics of Linux course at the world-class university known as LUT.
